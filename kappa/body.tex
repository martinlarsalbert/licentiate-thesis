\section{Background}
Modeling of shipâ€™s dynamics has a wide range of useful applications. This can be categorized as: white-box, black-box or grey-box modeling \cite{leifsson_grey-box_2008}. Most of the models in this thesis fall under the grey-box category.

\begin{itemize}
    \item White-box modeling \\
    involves applying physical principles, so that no observed data is required, for instance Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Semi-empirical models where unknown physical constants have been derived from previous experiments, can also be considered as white-box models \cite{leifsson_grey-box_2008}. Ikeda's method to predict roll damping \cite{ikeda_components_1978} is one example of this (see Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping}).  

    \item Black-box modeling \\
    means that parameters do not have physical significance but where the objectives is to find a good model that fits the observed data \cite{lindskog_tools_1995}.
    
    \item Grey-box modeling \\
    is a combination of white-box and black-box modeling methods, so that both a physical model and data is required. This concept is also referred as semi-physical modeling, hybrid modeling or semi-mechanistic modeling \cite{leifsson_grey-box_2008} in the literature. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent The black-box modeling is entirely data driven, which means that no prior understanding of the system generating the data is needed. The main disadvantage is the dependence on the data used to model the system, which can result in limited extrapolation properties beyond the data that it is derived from \cite{leifsson_grey-box_2008}. 
In a grey box model the white and black parts can be combined in several ways using either a serial or parallel approach \cite{leifsson_grey-box_2008}. 
Grey-box modelling is often used in situations where white-box models are not giving the required accuracy by introducing some corrections before or after the white-box in a serial approach. 
Grey-box modeling of a motorcycle shock absorber \cite{beghi_grey-box_2007} is an example of the parallel approach where the low frequency dynamics is handled by a white box and the higher frequencies are handled by a black box.

\section{Motivation and objective}
A majority of the publications in the field of system identification use simulated data with added white noise. Even though noise has been added, the estimator is still perfect, which means that these methods are not solving the whole problem, where both noise and system model should be unknown. Only when using data obtained from real physical systems, from model tests or full scale ship operation, the whole system identification problem is addressed.
