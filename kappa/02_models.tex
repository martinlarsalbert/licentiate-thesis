The ship's dynamics comprises the forces and motions in the six degrees of freedoms (6DOF): surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw. Heave and pitch motions are often neglected in calm water conditions, so that a four degrees of freedom (4DOF) model is sufficient to express the ship's dynamics. Models for roll and the manoeuvring model for the remaining DOFs are presented in section \ref{sec:roll} and section \ref{sec:manoeuvring model}. 

\section{Roll motion} \label{sec:roll}
The roll motion without manoeuvres in calm water with no external forces can be expressed with Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_general_himeno} \cite{himeno_prediction_1981},
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_general_himeno}
\noindent The ship roll motion can be observed under those conditions in a so called roll-decay test. The model is forced to an initial roll angle as seen in \autoref{fig:rolldecay_initial}. The model is then released (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_free}) and rolls back to equilibrium (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_equilibrium}). But the model will pass the equilibrium due to the momentum and not stop until it has reached the end point on the other side (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_endpoint}). This starts a new cycle, where the model rolls back again, resulting in an oscillatory motion where potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy and back.

\noindent This oscillation would be going on forever, if it wasn't for the roll damping. Interactions between the ship and the water in terms of: as friction, wave generation, eddy generation and hydrodynamic lift will cause the ship to lose some of its energy. This means that the oscillation is decaying over time as seen in \autoref{fig:rolldecay}, showing the time series for the roll angle and where the decaying amplitude of the oscillation is also shown.

\noindent The damping $B_{44}\left(\dot{\phi}\right)$ can be expressed as expansion series:  
$ B_{44}\left(\dot{\phi}\right) = B_1\cdot\dot{\phi} + B_2\cdot\dot{\phi}\left|\dot{\phi}\right| + B_3\cdot\dot{\phi}^3 + ... + B_n\cdot\dot{\phi}^n$. Most often, the so-called ``linear model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_linear}), ``quadratic model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic_b}) and ``cubic model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_cubic}) are used to represent $B_{44}(\dot{\phi})$ by truncating the series to keep only linear, quadratic and cubic terms,
