A ship's dynamics comprises forces and motions in the six degrees of freedoms (6DOF): surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw. Heave and pitch motions are often neglected in calm water conditions, so that a four degrees of freedom (4DOF) model is sufficient to express the ship's dynamics. Models for roll and the manoeuvring model for the remaining DOFs are presented in section \ref{sec:roll} and section \ref{sec:manoeuvring model} below. 

\section{Roll motion} \label{sec:roll}
The roll motion without manoeuvres in calm water with no external forces can be expressed by  \cite{himeno_prediction_1981},
\input{equations/roll_decay_equation_general_himeno}
\noindent Where the static stability of the ship is described by the stiffness $C_{44}(\phi)$ as function of roll angle $\phi$, the damping $B_{44}(\dot{\phi})$ as function of roll velocity $\dot{\phi}$ and inertia $A_{44}$ connected to the roll acceleration $\ddot{\phi}$. The ship roll motion can be observed under these conditions in a so called roll-decay test. The model is forced to an initial roll angle as seen in \autoref{fig:rolldecay_initial}. The model is then released (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_free}) and rolls back to equilibrium (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_equilibrium}). But the model will pass the static equilibrium point due to the momentum and not stop until it has reached the end point on the other side (\autoref{fig:rolldecay_endpoint}). This starts a new cycle, where the model rolls back again, resulting in an oscillatory motion where potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy and back.

\noindent This oscillation would be going on forever, if it wasn't for the energy losses in roll damping. Interactions between the ship and the water in terms of: friction, wave generation, eddy generation and hydrodynamic lift will cause the ship to lose some of its energy. This means that the oscillation is decaying over time as seen in \autoref{fig:rolldecay}, showing the time series for the roll angle.

\noindent The damping $B_{44}\left(\dot{\phi}\right)$ can be expressed as an expansion series:  
\begin{equation}
    B_{44}\left(\dot{\phi}\right) = B_1\cdot\dot{\phi} + B_2\cdot\dot{\phi}\left|\dot{\phi}\right| + B_3\cdot\dot{\phi}^3 + ... + B_n\cdot\dot{\phi}^n
\end{equation}
 
\noindent This series can be truncated to expressed a ``linear model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_linear}), ``quadratic model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic_b}) and ``cubic model'' (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_cubic}).

Models for the remaining degrees of freedoms are presented in the next section.
