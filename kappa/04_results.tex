\section{Summary Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping}}
\subsection*{"\nameref{pap:rolldamping}"}
In Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping}, time series data from 250 roll decay tests (see Fig. \ref{fig:ship_types}) assembled from the Maritime Dynamics Laboratory at SSPA Sweden AB (\href{www.sspa.se}{www.sspa.se}) are used to investigate the roll motion model.

\end{figure}

\noindent Parameters in the linear (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_linear}), quadratic (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic_b}) and cubic (Eq.\ref{eq:roll_decay_equation_cubic}) roll motion model are identified using the roll motion  (see section \ref{sec:_roll}). The investigation shows that the quadratic damping model has almost the same accuracy as the cubic model. The ''integration approach'' (see section \ref{sec:integration_approach}) to  roll motion, produces the most accurate models compared to the ''derivation approach'' (see section \ref{sec:derivation_approach}).

\subsection{Generic roll damping model}
\label{sec:genericrolldampingmodel}
A serial grey-box model for ship roll damping (see Fig.\ref{fig:greyrolldamping}) is also developed in Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping}. 
This is expanding the system identification, not only focusing on one ship, but rather all modern ships, by a prediction model of the damping coefficients from the  applied on a whole database of roll decay tests. 
Simplified Ikeda's method \cite{kawahara_simple_2011} is used as the white box model, which is combined with a following black-box correction model.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Grey-box model to predict roll damping}
    \label{fig:greyrolldamping}
\end{figure}

\noindent The roll damping data set, obtained from the roll motion investigation, is used to train the black-box part of the grey-box model. The black-box correction model of the output components from the Simplified Ikeda's method are shown in (Eq.\ref{eq:polynom_correction}),
\input{equations/polynom_correction}

\noindent Large corrections of the skin friction damping $\hat{B_F}$ and wave damping $\hat{B_W}$ are suggested by this expression. This is because the Simplified Ikeda's method is not very accurate for this dataset, where most of the ships in the dataset exceed the limits of the method. A pure black-box model is also devloped in Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping} (see Eq.\ref{eq:polynom_complex}),
\input{equations/polynom_complex}

\noindent The grey-box model and the black-box model above, have about the same accuracy when performing cross-validation on the roll damping dataset. The linearized equivalent damping $B_e$ is calculated with \autoref{eq:B_e_equation} \cite{himeno_prediction_1981}. The damping and frequency is nondimensionalized with \autoref{eq:be_eqvalent} and \autoref{eq:omega0_hat_equation} \cite{himeno_prediction_1981}.

\input{equations/B_e_equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:be_eqvalent}
    \hat{B_e} = \frac{B_e}{\rho \bigtriangledown Beam^2} \sqrt{\frac{Beam}{2g}},
\end{equation}

\section{Summary Paper \ref{pap:daiyong}}
\subsection*{"\nameref{pap:daiyong}"}
Least Square Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) \cite{brereton_support_2010} is used in Paper \ref{pap:daiyong} to identify the parameters in the AVMM.  
The data is taken from experimental tests on a lake using a ship model with a scale of 50:1. The configuration of sensors and equipment for the experiment is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:cthmodel}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{kappa/images/cth_model.png}
    \caption{Configuration of sensors and equipment for the experimental tests.}
    \label{fig:cthmodel}
\end{figure}
\noindent The hydrodynamic derivatives of the AVMM are identified almost perfectly when applied on data from simulations with MSS toolbox Mariner \cite{tristan_matlab_2009}. The  does however not work at all when applied on the data obtained from the lake experiments as seen in Fig.\ref{fig:daiyong_extrapolation}. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Prediction with AVMM of zigzag lake experiments.}
    \label{fig:daiyong_extrapolation}
\end{figure}

\noindent The  is very sensitive to noise due to the differentiation that needs to be conducted to calculate velocities and yaw rate from the measured position and heading. The  works better if the data is first cleaned using a proposed preprocessing algorithm together with a Kalman Filter (KF). The simulations with the identified model and the experiments were however still not in very good agreement.     

\section{Summary Paper \ref{pap:pit}}
\subsection*{"\nameref{pap:pit}"}
A new method for System Identification of ship manoeuvring dynamics is developed in Paper \ref{pap:pit}. The system model for the ship manoeuvring is assumed to be represented by a manoeuvring model (see Section \ref{sec:manoeuvring model}). The appropriate manoeuvring model for the specific ship and data is selected from a set of candidate VMMs, with varying complexity as a function of its number of hydrodynamic derivatives. The appropriate manoeuvring model is selected to give a robust model that can make predictions outside the domain covered by the available training data. A cross validation scheme is proposed to be used in the selection. In this scheme, the validation set has larger drift angles, yaw rates and rudder angles compared to the training set as seen in the example in Fig.\ref{fig:cross_validation}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{kappa/images/3.pdf}
    \caption{wPCC training, validation and testing datasets.}
    \label{fig:cross_validation}
\end{figure}
\noindent A new  for VMMs (see Section \ref{sec:_VMM}), with large focus on the data cleaning, is also proposed in Paper \ref{pap:pit}. This  is investigated together with the method to select a appropriate and robust manoeuvring model for two very different cases. The wPCC test case which is a twin screw Pure Car Truck Carrier and the KVLCC2 being a single screw Very Large Crude Carrier.    
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item It is shown that the hydrodynamic derivatives within a manoeuvring model can be identified exactly at ideal conditions with no measurement noise and a perfect estimator.
    
    \item It is shown that the proposed prepossessing of measurement data with EKF + RTS run in iteration with initial guess from semi-empirical formulas, is better than using low-pass filters for cleaning. \autoref{fig:lowpass-accuracy} shows the average simulation error with the  using various low-pass filters or the EKF + RTS smoother.

        \label{fig:lowpass-accuracy}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item The  has large problems with multicollinearity for the AVMM. The absolute correction between the features is shown in \autoref{fig:ncorr}. This was less of a problem for the less complex model MAVMM.

        \label{fig:ncorr}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item The new method can predict turning circle manoeuvres with less than 5 \% error in advance and tactical diameter for the wPCC and KVLCC2 test cases. Track plot of the wPCC result is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:turning_circle_wpcc}.
