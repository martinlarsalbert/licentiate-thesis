This thesis presents research performed since February 2020 at the Division of Marine Technology, Department of Mechanics and Marine Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology and SSPA Sweden AB (\href{www.sspa.se}{www.sspa.se}). Financial support for this research was provided by the DEMOPS project (Development of Methods for Operational Performance of Ships) funded by the Swedish Transport Administration (project: FP4 2020) and the D2E2F project (Data Driven Energy Efficiency of Ships) funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (project: 49301-1).

I had unsuccessfully been applying for funding of my PhD studies for a couple of years when Professor Wengang Mao contacted me three years ago with the offer to become a PhD student. Otherwise, I would probably be still searching for funding. I will always be very grateful for this opportunity. Wengang has also been my main supervisor during my studies, a guide in academic research, and a tutor in statistical and machine learning methods.  

This gratitude also goes to my examiner and co-supervisor, Professor Jonas W. Ringsberg,
head of the Division of Marine Technology. I have enjoyed our discussions about research methodology and how to organize a paper in academic writing, where his detailed proofreading has also been a great asset.

I also want to thank SSPA Sweden AB for allowing me to be an industrial PhD student within my current employment. A special thanks to Dr. Christian Finnsg√•rd, head of the Research Department at SSPA, for his support and good advice throughout the project. I also want to mention all the personnel at SSPA who have been involved in model tests, building the ship models, and conducting the experiments.
