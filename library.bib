	abstract = {Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analysing roll motions. In this paper, the simplified Ikeda method (SI-method) is compared with the original Ikeda method. The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.},

	abstract = {It is essential to describe a ship’s manoeuvrability for various applications, e.g. optimal control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). In this study, the capability of two recognised manoeuvrability models to predict ships’ trajectories is investigated based on both simulation and open-water experiment test data. The parameters of these models are estimated by a statistical learning method. The goodness of the two estimated models for describing a merchant ship’s manoeuvrability is first studied using her manoeuvring simulation data. Then, experimental manoeuvring tests to use a USV in open water with wind and drifting effects are used to check the conventional model identification procedures. Finally, some modifications and adjustments are proposed to improve the conventional procedures. It shows that the proposed procedures can accurately derive the ship’s manoeuvrability based on experimental data.},

	abstract = {Getting the best possible accuracy with the lowest possible computational cost is an important factor in the early design stage of ships. Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) method. The hybrid method is investigated using roll decay tests with the KVLCC2 test case. This investigation shows that the accuracy of simulated roll motions is significantly improved and also shows good agreement with the corresponding roll decay model tests.},

	abstract = {Identifying the ship’s maneuvering dynamics can build models for ship maneuverability predictions with a wide range of useful applications. A majority of the publications in this ﬁeld are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identiﬁcation process can be decomposed into ﬁnding a suitable Vessel Manoeuvring Model (VMM) for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A Parameter Identiﬁcation Technique (PIT) is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable VMM is found using the PIT with cross-validation on a set of competing VMMs. The PIT uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very diﬀerent maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Turning circle predictions with the Robust VMMs, trained on zigzag model tests, show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.},

	title = {A {STUDY} {OF} {METHODS} {TO} {PREDICT} {ADDED} {RESISTANCE} {IN} {WAVES}},
	abstract = {This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method
can be developed.
Added resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them
developed during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following
waves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these
cases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.
In this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is
implemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The
implementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These
evaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using
Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method.
This thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.
This simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended
to be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship
design. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip
calculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency
and spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical
results from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25\%,
which is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in
waves.},
